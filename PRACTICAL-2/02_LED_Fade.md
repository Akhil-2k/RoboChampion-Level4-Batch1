AIM:
  To Make the LED’s Brightness lower and lower at the time increases. 

COURSE OF ACTION :
By using a PWM pin on the Arduino, we will be able to increase and decrease the intensity of Brightness of the LED.
Make use of Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)-Pin 9.
It is the technique to get analog results with digital pins. The value ranges from 0 to 255.
We are going to decrease the brightness from 255 to 0 decreasing 5 after every second until the minimum value is reached.
